  <p>We are always talking about someone’s successful speculation that makes him or her a billionaire or a high official. Today I will bring you an impressive speculation that maketh a dynasty and several successful families.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>In 1644, riot peasants led by Li Zicheng conquered Beijing, the capital city of the Ming Dynasty. And Emperor Chongzhen, the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, committed suicide in the Mei Mountain inside the Palace Museum. The Great Ming Empire collapsed.</p>
<p><img src="E:/Hexo/%E6%9D%8E%E8%87%AA%E6%88%90.png#pic_center" alt="avatar"></p>
<p>A few days later, under the name of  “avenging for the Ming people”, the Qing Army entered the Shanhai Pass, the northern gate of the Beijing, and began to establish a national regime. The year 1644 marked the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p><img src="E:/Hexo/%E5%B1%B1%E6%B5%B7%E5%85%B3.png#pic_center" alt="avatar"></p>
<p>The number of troops when the Qing Army entered the Shanhai Pass has always been a controversial issue because there’s no detailed accurate record in history books. However, the prevailing view among historians is that the Eight Banners of Manchuria[1] (including the Eight Banners of the Manchu Army, the Eight Banners of Mongolian Army and the Eight Banners of Han Army) only has around 90,000 soldiers when the Qing Army entered the Shanhai Pass–no more than 100,000 people. After adding Wu Sangui’s[2] troops, it was generally considered that the Qing Army and the Wu Army had 120,000 or so troops. </p>
<p>However, comparing with the Qing Army, the population of the Han-people army, including the Ming  army , the Dashun army of Li Zicheng, and the Western army led by another peasant riot leader, was between three and five million. The number of Han toops alone is nearly a hundred times as many Qing troops. Of course, this data is somewhat inflated, but the number of Han people troops is at least thirty times than that of the Qing troops.</p>
<p>However, comparing with the Qing army, the population of the Han-people army, including the Ming army, the Dashun army of Li Zicheng, and the Western army led by another peasant riot leader, was between three and five million. The Han-people army outnumbered the Qing army nearly one hundred times. Undeniably, this number was somewhat inflated, but the number of Han-people army was at least thirty times than that of the Qing troops. </p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that even each soldier of the Qing troop can fight against ten Han people, the Han-people troop would still win–the population advantage of the Han-people army is enormous. However, after the Qing army entered the Shanhai Pass, in northern China they hardly encountered large-scale resistance. Li Zicheng claimed that he has one million troops, but when fighting with the Qing-Wu troops of only a hundred thousand soldiers, his army was defeated like a huge landslid. Li Zicheng himself escaped Beijing after claimed this city for tens of days.</p>
<p>Li Zicheng had at least one million soldiers, although compared with the Eight Banners and cavalries, the peasant rebel army was bad equipped and hardly received formal military training. But Li Zicheng had at least two hundred thousand elite troops, otherwise Li was not capable of taking over the northern China and sent the Ming empire to the hell. Li’s Dashun Army can defeat the Ming Army, and before the Qing Army entered the game, his troops besieged Wu Sangui’s army, leaving no chance for them to escape, and forced Wu to negotiate peace with him. But one the Qing Army joined in, the Dashun Army immediately became vulnerable. Li Zicheng was completely defeated in merely one year, and the Qing Army easily pacified northern China.</p>
<p>The predicted result based on population differences and the actual outcome was so distinct that gives the Manchu Eight Banners a mysterious cognition on themselves: “You cannot defeat a Manchu troop that has more than ten thousand soldiers.” Even now some decedents of the Eight Banners are still saying that sentence, as if their army were unbeatable. But is that true that they Qing Army was so strong that a single soldier can kill more than forty rivals? </p>
<p>After easily pacifying North China, the Qing Army encountered stiff resistance in southern China. And at the same time, the Army implemented the most fierce war policy there–they massacred all the residents in tens of conquered cities. It was not until 1683, 40 year after the Qing Army entered the Shanhai Pass, when the Emperor Kangxi sent General Lang Shi to Taiwan to destroy the Zheng Regime which support the Ming and against the Qing, that marked the completion of putting down armies against the Qing ruling. </p>
<p>Why did the Manchu quickly pacify the northern China? Many historians reckon that the Manchus gained the support from the Han-people landlord class. Under the name of “avenging for the Ming people, we are fighting against the Dashun Army”, through bribing and abolishing heavy taxation, the Manchus protected the interests of the landlord class in North China and won their heart. So when the Qing Army came, they actively capitulated one after another and joined the Qing Army to help suppress resistance movements. This was the main reason why the Qing Dynasty was able to pacify northern China quickly.</p>
<p>But this did not fully explain why the Daishun army, which has more than one million soldiers, died out in just one year, and why the Qing troops were able to quickly take over the North China.</p>
<p>The main reason for the rapid pacification of the North by the Qing Army was indeed the support of Han-people bureaucrats and landlords. Li Zicheng and his army’s slogans like “Equally ditribute the land and abolish taxes” severely threatened and damaged the interests of the bureaucratic landlord class who controlled massive land, grain, and wealth; meanwhile, the Qing army was conducting their warfare under the name of “avenging for the Ming people”, which greatly lowered the psychological burden of the Han scholars. Plus, northern China was under continuous natural disasters, the warfare, and the following food shortage. What’s worse, in order to suppress the peasant uprisings, the Ming government charge heave taxes on citizens, which hurt people’s felling and their living. All the reasons above made the farmers, the main force of Li Zicheng’s army, hard to support themselves, so the power and fighting capacity of the Army was seriously affected.</p>
<p>Since the Emperor Wanli’s reign (1573-1620), plagues have occurred in Shanxi province. In the last years of Emperor Chongzhen’s reign (around 1640s), far more severe plague broke out in Shanxi province and caused countless death. It is worth mentioning that one doctor named Wu Youke was the first to discover viruses and bacteria could spread through the air when he was curing sick people in Shanxi province.</p>
<p>The great outbreak of plague seriously affected the foundation of the Dashun Army and weakened the army’s fighting capacity. But that’s not the decisive reason why the Qing Army was able to pacify northern China quickly. </p>
<p>The most important factor was the support of the Shanxi merchants capital group. </p>
<p>Note: </p>
<ol>
<li>the Eight Banners of Manchuria: one of the root political and military system of the Qing Dynasty. Eight Banners symbolize eight different troops led by the Emperor and his sons and cousins.</li>
<li>Wu Sangui: the former general of the Ming Dynasty. His duty was to led the troop defend the Qing troop in the Shanhai pass. However, hearing Emperor Chongzhen’s death, he gave up fighting and joined the Qing army.</li>
