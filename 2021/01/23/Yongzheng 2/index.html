  <p>In this article, we will continue exploring Emperor Yongzheng’s life and his achievements.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p><strong>The Liberation of the Untouchables</strong></p>
<p>In ancient China, scholars, peasants, industrialists and businessmen were all equal in social status. But in addition to these four kinds of citizens, there is a group of people who have a very diminishing social status–the untouchables. They suffered discrimination and persecution from all classes. All their lives they can only be engaged in prostitution, drama and other low paid work with poor social status, and not allowed to take the imperial examination. What’s worse, their identity of untouchable was inheritable–generations of them were in poor lives–no one in the family can get ride of it.  </p>
<p>Soon after Emperor Yongzheng ascended the throne, he followed the advice of Nian Gengyao’s son, Nian Xi, to liberate the untouchables in Shanxi province. These untouchables were descendants of Emperor Jianwen’s loyal ministers (Emperor Jianwen of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yongle’s nephew, lost his throne in the Riot of Jingnan initiated by his uncle, the later Emperor Yongle). After the Riot of Jingnan, they were relegated to untouchables by the new emperor, engaged in harlot activities, and such low identity passed down from generation to generation. They wanted to get rid of such low social status all the time, but were never allowed by the authorities and the gentry, who loved to bully them.</p>
<p>But in Nian Xi’s view, they were decedents of loyal ministers and should not be so cruelly mistreated. So with Emperor Yongzheng’s permission, these untouchables were finally liberated. They were separated from the low social identity and became normal citizens.</p>
<p>After consolidating the achievement of liberation in Shanxi province, Emperor Yongzheng began to liberate the untouchables in other places. The untouchables in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Huizhou provinces were liberated one after another. Since the Song Dynasty, the issue of untouchables has been an important historical problem, which has not been solved for hundreds of years. But only Emperor Yongzheng dared to lend a helping hand to these poor people and partly solved this long-annoying problem.</p>
<p>But here, we should also play a question mark for the purpose of the liberation of untouchables by Emperor Yongzheng. Some literature took this as his benevolent side, but ignores the large number of wrongful convictions caused by literary inquisitions he initiated. Personally, I prefer the following purpose: to rally the people and consolidate his ruling. Emperor Yongzheng was suspected of murdering his father and brother for his emperor seat. By liberating the untouchables, he could build up his “benevolence and righteousness” image and attract a large number of untouchables to support at the same time–this can help him build his own reputation. The untouchables were at the bottom of the society and oppressed by all sides, which has become a major factor of social instability. This big bomb may at some point push the empire into the abyss if not dealt properly. In this way, after being liberated, a large number of untouchables became normal people and worked hard to promote the development of social productive forces.</p>
<p>While liberating the untouchables is a grand feat, it was not a wholly successful “reform”. This action greatly offended the interests of the official and gentry, who made their money by enslaving untouchables. Therefore, the reform has not been carried forward smoothly, nor has it been entirely successful. The essence of this liberating the untouchables is to abolish the hierarchical differences between normal citizens and untouchables. Unfortunately, the existence of a caste system was in the interest of the feudal ruling class, which controlled most land over the empire and made money by enslaving the people at the bottom. It is in this way that the untouchability system has existed for thousands of years. This means that it is only possible to abolish the hierarchy from the root if the class system is abolished at all. So Emperor Yongzheng, the head of the feudal ruling class and its biggest beneficiary and the country’s biggest landowner, was obviously not able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Precious spiritual wealth: diligent in politics and not afraid of slander</strong></p>
<p>What Emperor Yongzheng left us is not only the material wealth, but also the spiritual treasure. In the films and TV dramas, Emperor Yongzheng seems to be a good lover, staying with his empresses all day long. However, in the real history, Emperor Yongzheng was really diligence in everyday national affairs. During his 13-year reign, he personally reviewed the memos from ministers every day. In the tens of thousands of copies of memos have been preserved, he even wrote notes and instructions of thousands of words on some of them.</p>
<p>Emperor Yongzheng only slept four hours a day, and spent all the rest time on working. It is because of such diligence that he had exhausted all his vitality and passed away after ruling China 13 years. (Undeniably, another important contributing factor leading to his death was poisonous elixirs–for the sake of “long-living”, he was addicted to elixirs made of mercury and other toxic elements.) More importantly, in those 13 years he chanced the descending trend of the empire started in the late period of his father’s ruling.<br>In addition, Emperor Yongzheng was also capable of confront infamy. Before him, Emperor Shihuang of the Qin Dynasty (the first emperor in Chinese history) and Emperor Wudi of the Han Dynasty also initiated reforms that offended people with vested interests, and they were criticized by literati after their death. Seeing those two emperors’ cases, Emperor Yongzheng still dare to make his reform for the ordinary people. In his view, the interest groups who control the literati will denigrate him to nothing–but Emperor Yongzheng did not show a trace of fear.</p>
<p>There are many emperors who can establish an empire in Chinese history, but few are as good as Emperor Yongzheng in making the empire prosperous. It is true that Emperor Yongzheng had shortcomings and committed many unforgivable sins. However, from a historical point of view, Emperor Yongzheng is still a successful emperor and a brave emperor. As the song says:</p>
<p>“Dedicating his heart into making history and his empire prosperous, and it is unavoidable to be criticized after death. But he won’t be a nobody in the long river of Chinese history!”</p>
