      Secret Services in the Ming Dynasty

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
          
        <p>Recently I read a article about the Stasi, the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (Ministry of National Security). This reminded me of the secret services in the Ming Dynasty…..</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The article said that the Stasi monitors every aspect of people’s lives, and employed more than 91000 full-time employees and more than 190000 informers. </p>
<p>The article also illustrate that the Stasi would record everything: every word you said, any noise in the room, and even extramarital affairs.</p>
<p>Quiet scaring, right?</p>
<p>Well, I have to say, the Ming Dynasty had played such game since its establishment.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. Song Lian, one of the founding fathers of the Ming Dynasty, the then teacher of the Prince, once held a dinner party at his home. The second day, the Emperor Hongwu, the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, called in Song, and asked him three questions: Did you drink yesterday? Who did you invited? What kind of food did you have? Fortunately, Song answered these questions honestly. After hearing his answers, the Emperor Hongwu was satisfied, and said: “Good, you did not lie to me.” While speaking, he showed Song a drawing that painted the scene of Song’s dinner party, including foods, drinks, and even the seating orders! No doubt, Song was heavily shocked.</p>
<p>The secret service appears here is called Jinyiwei, the first spy agency established by the Emperor Hongwu 15 years after the founding of the Ming Dynasty. Its primary goal was to hunt for the “sins” of the founding fathers and to criminalize them in order to whittle their power. Later, the functions of Jinyiwei were gradually expanded to supervise officials, fight against corruption and protect the Emperor. The head of the Jinyiwei was called the Commander, who was selected from the Emperor’s faithful trusted followers, and the Commander directly report to the Emperor and only follow the Emperor’s orders. Additionally, Jinyiwei also have the rights to interrogate the prisoners.</p>
<p>Under Jinyiwei’s supervision, it’s easy for the Emperor to know the situations of his ministers. Song Lian’s experience was common at that time. The Emperor would always know every word his ministers said, everything his ministers done.</p>
<p>The second secret service of the Ming Dynasty was founded by the Emperor Yongle, the third Emperor of the Ming Dynasty. Emperor Yongle lunched an insurrection and seized his nephew’s throne. Rumors that his nephew was still alive appeared form time to time; additionally, because of the insurrection, many essential ministers in the Court did not for him. To consolidate his reign and search for the potentially alive nephew, he desired a strong enforcement institution. The existing secret service, Jinyiwei, cannot fulfill his need, so he decided to set up a new secret agency—the Dongchang. Dongchang was composed by eunuchs. In ancient times, officials lived outside the Palace, but eunuchs lived inside the Palace. In this way, if anything happened, the eunuchs can tell the Emperor in the first place. Unlike the Jinyiwei which mainly supervise the royal family members and government officials, Dongchang monitored government officials and ordinary citizens. But at the beginning, Dongchang did not have the right to interrogate prisoners. However, in the following decades, Dongchang kept developing, and ultimately set up its own prison—the Zhaoyu. Dongchang’s agents can directly put people into their prison and extort confessions by torture without any certifications. For people at that time, the Zhaoyu was like the hell.</p>
<p>The third secret service of the Ming Dynasty was the Xichang, but its establishment was based on a so-called supernatural event. During the reign of the Emperor Chenghua, the eighth Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, there was a mystery case called “Demon Fox” at first; then a diabolism Li Zilong performed his tricks in the capital city for defrauding money. Li Zilong also met a few eunuch officials, who often lead him into the palace to play his tricks. Ultimately Jinyiwei arrested Li Zilong and his friends. No more fraud tricks in the capital city. But the Emperor Chenghua were still suspicious. Fearing such things took place again, the Emperor desired to know what was happening in the fol. So he sent a eunuch named Wang Zhi to recruit detective and collect information from the folk. Wang Zhi caught this opportunity: he brought many gossips from the folk to meet the Emperor’s need. The Emperor considered these messages useful and also satisfied with Wang Zhi’s job. A few months later, the Emperor Chenghua set up a new secret service—the Xichang. Undoubtably, Wangzhi was in charge of the new secret service.</p>
<p>Xichang had more power than Dongchang and Jinyiwei. It also has the right to arrest the suspect without any permissions. But Wang Zhi was far more crazy than any leader of the Dongchang and JInyiwei. In order to enlarge and consoling his power, he lunched plenty of wrongful conviction to against his rivals. But as an old saying goes, too much water drowned the miller. Emperor Chenghua set up Xichang to consolidate his reign by monitoring citizens and officials. But Wang Zhi went too far, and his power expanded so fast that the Emperor started consider him as a threat. As a result, Wang Zhi was driven out of the capital city and Xichang was disbanded. </p>
<p>The Emperors of the Ming Dynasty were all clever and smart, but they put all their intelligence on consolidating the imperial power and making officials against each other. The three secret service agencies mentioned above are products of such ruling method. It is true that these secret services serve as watchdogs and consolidated the imperial power, but the lawlessness of these institutions has caused great panic among government officials and citizens. During Emperor Chenghua’s reign, the three spy agencies coexisted, their spies were everywhere, and the normal political order was disrupted, which is bad for the whole nation.</p>
