  <p>During the reign of Emperor Wudi, five major currency reforms occurred.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The Han Dynasty had always allowed civilian to mint currency before the era of Emperor Wu. The reason for this is simple: the ruler believed it can stimulate the economic development of the civilian, and facilitate the use of copper coins by the people at the same time.</p>
<p>But this seemingly well-intentioned approach did not actually benefit the people at the bottom.</p>
<p>When the First emperor and Emperor Wen in the early Han Dynasty gave orders to allow the civilian to freely mint copper coins and adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards private casting by the people, the beneficiaries were only the aristocrats, despot and wealthy businessmen, not the common people. At that time, these nobleman and wealthy businessmen possess their own mines and also had more abundant capital. So after the Emperor Wen opened up private casting, the result was that the princes of each principalities used the mines in their own territory to casting coins, and they were rich as a country, lead to rebellion eventually.</p>
<p>Of course, if these nobleman and wealthy businessmen simply use their resources to mint copper coins, to be honest, there is nothing wrong, but in fact they are not content to mint regular “four bahts coin.” When coining currency, they will often scrape four bahts coin. For example, after collecting the four bahts coin from the common people, they will use a knife to rasion the copper scraps from the back of the coin, and then use these copper scraps to cast a new batch of “four bahts coin”, so they can do “money makes money” almost without cost.</p>
<p>But the consequence of this is that the four bahts coin circulating among the people has became thinner and thinner, and more and more copper coins were minted by the nobleman. What followed was the inevitability of causing inflation, the money in the hands of the common people became less and less valuable, but the prices of goods were rising day by day. In the end, a Dan(59.20kg) of grain need bought with 10,000 four bahts coin, and a horse need to bought with 100 taels of gold. Crazy inflation left the people without profit. If this continues for a long time, there will be turmoil in the entire Han Dynasty like the end of Qin Dynasty, and the only way for the common people to survive is to rebel. In this situation, when the imperial throne of the Han Dynasty was passed to Emperor Wu, the currency system reform had reached the degree where it had to be changed.</p>

In the end, a Dan(59.20kg) of grain need bought with 10,000 four bahts coin, and a horse need to bought with 100 taels of gold. Crazy inflation left the people without profit. If this continues for a long time, there will be turmoil in the entire Han Dynasty like the end of Qin Dynasty, and the only way for the common people to survive is to rebel. In this situation, when the imperial throne of the Han Dynasty was passed to Emperor Wu, the currency system reform had reached the degree where it had to be changed.</p>
<p>After Emperor Wu succeeded to the imperial throne, he launched counterattack wars year after year, and coupled with the occurrence of natural disasters such as drought, the treasuries in various regions of the Han Dynasty were already empty. However, in sharp contrast to the emptiness of the Han Dynasty treasury, the wealthy merchants were rich as a country, and their treasury’s possessions were countless, but these wealth could never used by the country and the common people.</p>
<p>So in the end, Emperor Wu and the ministers in the court decided to use currency reform to turn the so-called wealth of these merchants into useless wealth, and then turned to create a lot of taxation for the country’s finances. With this original intention, , the Han Dynasty carried out six currency reforms during the Emperor Wu’s era, and finally completely solved the problem of private casting and pirates that had plagued Han Dynasty for nearly a hundred years, and it also made the future Han Dynasty financial revenue become increasingly rich.<br>Emperor Wu first reformed the currency system was in B.C.140. At this time Emperor Wu ordered the whole country to start using three bahts coin. Of course, at this time, Emperor Wu did not abolish the previously popular four bahts coin, but only let the three bahts coin become popular among the people together with the four bahts coin. However, this reform finally failed. Because the three bahts coin at that time was circulated at the same value as the four baht weight half tael, but the three bahts coin used less copper than the four bahts, so the civilians were not pleased to accept it, coupled with the prevalence of pirate casting, eventually the three bahts coin failed to circulate in the market. However, although the three bahts did not circulate, it has succeeded in changing the “ tael” unit of currency since the introduction of the “half  tael” by Qin Shihuang into a “baht” unit.</p>
<p>In the spring of B.C.136, Emperor Wu abolished the three bahts and reused four bahts a half tael. Of course, the re-use of the four bahts did not mean that Emperor Wu had compromised with private pirates. The four bahts a half tael used by Emperor Wu afterwards were not the popular copper coins before. First of all, this kind of currency was stipulated the weight must be four tael by law. In addition, Emperor Wu’s four bahts coin was more complicated in design. In this way, Emperor Wu is gradually solving the problem of folk pirates and consuming the wealth of the wealthier at the same time. After all, the four bahts a half tael is legally required to weigh four tael at this time, and more complex shapes are added, which can prevent profiteers from grinding copper chips from copper coins as easily as before, in fact, these measures are increasing the cost of private casting, so that the pirates will give up the casting.</p>
<p>Seventeen years have passed. In these 17 years, Emperor Wu quickly exhausted the wealth accumulated during the Rule of Wen and Jing period(B.C.180-B.C.141)due to frequent wars, and even the soldiers’ military pay could not afford. In such an environment, Emperor Wu decided to carry out the currency system reform again, and compared with the previous two reforms, this reform was even bigger. Emperor Wu first obeyed the suggestion and decorated it with a square ruler of white deer skin, which was a leather coin, which was worth 400,000 coin. At the same time, he asked the royal family need to meet the emperor with leather coins as gifts. Subsequently, gold was divided into three classes, with gold being the first class, platinum being the middle class, and red gold being the inferior class, and the “silver-tin alloys” currency was issued. Emperor Wu wanted to set a high price for these leather goods, silver and tin, which were originally adequately stocked by the central government, and then seize the opportunity to plunder the huge wealth of those merchants to increase the court’s fiscal revenue.</p>
<p>At the same time, after the two currencies were issued, Emperor Wu also ordered to destroy half tael coins and cast three baht coins. This is Emperor Wu’s measure to replace half tael with three bahts after the first currency reform. In addition, in order to put an end to the prevalence of private pirates casting, Emperor Wu also ordered a strict law such as “ who pirates casting will sentence to death.” However, the reform actually failed, especially in curbing private coin casting. Although there was a severe punishment for the death of the criminal who pirates casting coin was ordered by Emperor Wu, it did not stop private coin casting.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the previous high-value silver-tin alloys issued by Emperor Wu have once again stimulated folk pirates. In addition, the ministers of Emperor Wu were also expressed constant opinions on the method of replacing money with “white deerskin coins”. Countless ministers said that the prices of leather coins were too high and inconsistent with their actual value.</p>
