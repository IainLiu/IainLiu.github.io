        <p>This is my favorite part!!! Though this part will tell you how the silver poisoned the Ming Empire and killed him, complex links and cause-and-effects relations are also showed in this part.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Last week we were talking about how silver saved the Ming Dynasty, so this week we will see something different.</p>
<p>However, dialectics tells that everyone coin has two sides. Thanks to silver, the Ming Dynasty survived for another century. But the collapse of the Ming Dynasty was also ultimately caused by silver.</p>
<p>We all know a famous statement: China’s capitalism sprouted in the middle and late Ming Dynasty. But what many people may not know is that it was Chinas demand for and imports of silver that sprouted the capitalism.</p>
<p>For Ming Dynasty, silver is similar to modern foreign exchange. In exchange for foreign exchange, the Ming dynasty developed mature export-oriented economy, promoted the whole society toward specialization, commercialization. Especially in the region south to the Yangtze River, with the increasing domestic and foreign demand for silk and cotton fabric, more and more land has been converted to plant economic crops mulberry and hemp, and an increasing number of people were turning into the textile production and trade industry. Due to their unique geographic location that near the coast, they had made great fortunes in the gray zone of foreign trade.</p>
<p>Under prosperous foreign trade, the traditional feudal self-sufficient natural economy system has been devastated in the coastal areas of the southeast China.</p>
<p>Large quantity of silver entered China, created huge social wealth, and made many millionaires. All those contributed to the change in the view of money, consumption concepts, and social relations at that time.</p>
<p>The famous erotic novels The Golden Lotus championed the best-selling novel in the late Ming Dynasty, which was the result of prosperous commodity economy and followed the change in public reading interests. This has aroused the vigilance of some ideological conservatives, who believe that the worship of money and extravagant consumption is a reflection of the declining social morality. Conservatives blame such decline in morality on the society’s demand for silver. They called for a return to the pure feudal natural economy.</p>
<p>Such restoration is impossible.</p>
<p>But what the Court was really worrying about was not the commercial development or changes in social mortality caused by silver, but the completely loss of control over the empire’s currency.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Hongzhi, the ninth Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, (1488-1505), Minister of the National Treasure, Rui Qiu, started advising the Emperor to monopolize the right of issuing currency. If the Court gave up the right to issue currency, it would cause social chaos.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the fiat money of the Ming dynasty collapsed due to unlimited issuance and the following monster inflation, and silver replaced the banknote as the main currency of the empire. China’s silver production was limited, so the Ming government was unable to exercise the right to coin and issue the silver. Although the Court did not recognize silver as legal currency for a long time, but in fact, the whole empire had accepted the circulation of silver and admitted its importance. The government possessed very few silver currency, and a large number of imported silver currency was under foreign trader’s control, which means that the prominent businessmen controlled the empire’s economic lifeline. </p>
<p>Some officials, represented by Jun Qiu, foresaw the end of the state’s monopoly of issuing money in the mid and late Ming dynasty. The power of the central government  would be greatly weakened.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the late Ming dynasty, the government gradually made concessions to the merchants who controlled the import of silver and formulated a series of pro-business policies. The famous  tax reform “Single tax in Silver” is the product of the game between the government, the businessmen and the society inside the empire. Juzheng Zhang, the minister of the empire and the planner of the reform, once said, the new tax policy of “Single tax in Silver”  is “inevitable and imperative.” In line with the trend of monetization of silver, the national fiscal revenue of the Ming Dynasty doubled after the implementation of the “Single tax in Silver”: the Treasury revenue increased from 2 million taels of silver a year to about 4 million taels.</p>
<p>However, a huge crisis was on its way.</p>
<p>So many articles have analyzed various reason lead to the collapse of the Ming Dynasty, including climate change, farmers’s uprisings, strong enemy, etc. For me, I gonna consider the silver as another contributing factor.</p>
<p>Although the Emperors prohibited foreign trades successively, and would not abolish the maritime probation until the national crisis happens. In fact, with the help of global silver circulation, the Ming Dynasty played an important role as the world’s trade center in the Great Navigation era at the end of the 15th century. The Ming Dynasty unconsciously involved in the world economic system, which means its economic situation would be affected by global conditions.</p>
<p>Since the 1620s, the European broke out trade crisis. Mercantilism was prevalent among Spain and other countries. Under mercantilism, European nations  began to restrict the outflow of silver.  Before this there were more than 40 merchant ships staying in Manila; but by 1629, there were only six Chinese merchant ships left there. Trade shrank, and silver imported to China fell sharply.</p>
<p>In 1634, Spain imposed an emergency tax to restrict foreign trade.</p>
<p>In 1639, Chinese traders were massacred in Manila by Spanish and indigenous people.</p>
<p>In 1640, Japan cut off all trade relations with Macao.</p>
<p>In 1641, the Dutch seized the Malacca, and trade route between the Indian port of Qoa and Macau had also been cut down.</p>
<p>The amount of the silver flow into China declined sharply.</p>
<p>And all of these took place during the reign of Emperor Chongzhen, the last Emperor of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Court had long lost control of the currency, and years of war against the rival and famer s uprisings required huge amounts of money, which is silver. However, at this key point, the world was experiencing financial crisis, and the measures of silver import was almost cut off. This was the root why the Court was always short of money during the reign of Emperor Chongzhen. Besides his own failure, the global condition also contribute the tragedy happened during the last Emperor’s reign.</p>
<p>The Ming government responded by raising taxes. From 1618 to 1636, taxes were raised seven times in 18 years in response to the rival’s invasion and farmers uprisings throughout the empire. These new taxes drained a lot of silver from the society, making the whole society experiencing economic recession. Unfortunately, frequent natural disasters had made things even worse. Low food production and high taxations triggered more popular rebellion The Ming dynasty gradually stuck into a dead loop.</p>
<p>The corrupt officials and great merchants of the empire had the habit of hoarding silver. Huge amounts of silver were hidden in cellars and thus quit from the circulation as if they entered a black hole. And at that time, silver was in shortage, and more people hoard silver for protection their assets. As a result, there was less silver flowing in from abroad and less silver circulating domestically, causing a severe silver shortage.</p>
<p>In 1643, Jiang Chen from Anhui province went to Beijing to serve as the deputy minister of the ministry of National Treasure. He had experienced a popular uprising in his hometown. In his diary, he wrote, “Today, homeless people are all over the empire, what they did was merely robbing the rich of silver.”</p>
<p>A year later, the Ming Dynasty collapsed. Silver endowed it another century’s life, but ultimately push it into death.</p>
