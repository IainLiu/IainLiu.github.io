  <p>This part mainly focus on Emperor Wuzong’s achievements.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p><strong>Be well versed in both literature and military affairs but more of self-assertion</strong></p>
<p>In the royal family, fetes are the top priority. But Emperor Wuzong of Ming seldom pays attention to these red tapes. Compared with ritual activities such as sacrifice to heaven, ancestor worship, or going to the countryside, he favors riding, safaris and shooting. When he was still the prince, he was “smart and keen on riding and shooting.” After becoming the emperor, he was even more “Getting up with bow and arrow, and going out of the Imperial Palaces’ door to shoot the birds.” Moreover, although, most emperors suffer from leading troops, but Emperor Wuzong of Ming took military exercises for pleasure. It is recorded in the history books that “the Emperor is good at military arts, so he specially set up the east and west official halls in the forbidden”,which was called “Waisijia”. Emperor Wuzong once selected eunuchs who were good at riding and shooting, and managed them in person, so that they were called the “Zhongjun”. Every day, Emperor Wuzong wore military uniforms and personally inspected the army, which was shown in one poem “Practice with calling out in morning and evening drills, and the sound of artillery reaches the nine doors of the Imperial Palaces.”</p>
<p>The most interesting is that Emperor Wuzong also claimed to be the “Mighty General Commander of Military Affairs” and gave himself an order for the expedition. Not only changed his own name to “Zhu Shou”, but later he gave himself a title “Zhen Guo Gong” (the highest title of military nobility). He also requested that all official documents be executed in the name of “Mighty General”. However, the cabinet all believed that according to the ancestor’s law and the heavenly will, to comfort people, the emperor should be above the general who is always considered as a courtier. So adding to the ranks to the Emperor was to reduce the emperor’s status. Unexpectedly, Emperor Wuzong didn’t take it seriously. And the so called “the distinction between one’s official title and one’s title is completely different” in the History of Ming Dynasty can be traced back here. Compared with the predecessor Emperor who was fascinated by art or immortals-seeking, he did not live in the secluded palace like Emperors of the Han race, but more similar to Shanyu and Khan of the grassland people.</p>
<p>Emperor Wuzong was not only brave and good at shooting and fond of military arts, but very knowledgeable. He is proficient in Buddhism and Islam, giving himself a title of Buddha and an Islamic name called “Miaoji Aolan.” which means “Glory of Allah”. Born with amazing language talent, he was able to read Buddhist scriptures in Tibetan (Fan) and Sanskrit. According to the records of the The record of Li Chao of North Korea, “When the emperor Wuzong traveled, he would choose two or three in those envoys, such as Tatar, Huihui, Frangji, Champa, Jiama and others, to follow for learning languages, or observing language-speaking skills.” It is very likely that Zhu Huzhao (Emperor Wuzong) also learned some Portuguese from a Portuguese translator-“Fireman Yasan”, making him the first emperor in Chinese history who can speak a Western European language.</p>
<p><strong>With both polite letters and martial arts，emperor Wuzong led the army in person and defeated the Tatar cavalry.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, although Emperor Wuzong is not known for diligence and even considered greedy for fun, he has never been delayed in reviewing memorials and dealing with major national affairs. After ascending the throne, he did two great things that his predecessor did not succeed. The first is the reformation of taxation system in areas south of the Yangtze River. Since the reign of Emperor Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang, the region south of Yangtze River has been overtaxed. In the eighth year of Zhengde (1513), Emperor Wuzong comprehensively implemented tax reforms in that area, which not only reduced the burden on the people, but also enabled local government to pay off taxes that had been owed to the central counterpart for ten years within two years. The second event is the reform of the Shibosi (Overseas Trading Department). He strengthened its tax-collecting function, expanded the government’s tax sources, and took the first step to lift the maritime ban.In the 15 years of Emperor Wuzong’s reign, the country’s finance has improved greatly.</p>
<p>Emperor Taizu of Ming, Zhu Yuanzhang, expelled the Tartars and set capital in the central plain.</p>
<p>And Emperor Chengzu of Ming, Zhu Di, moved his capital to Beijing where is not far from the border to stabilize the gate of the country. His fears came from the Mongolia in north of the desert.</p>
<p>While Emperor Wuzong, Zhu Houzhao was even bolder in his government. He set up the Xuanwu Zhen Guogong, the highest military noble who lead army defend Mongolia, directly on the frontier so that he could take command at any time when Mongolia invaded.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of Zhengde (1517), the Tatar prince with 50,000 horses entered Zhongyuan from Yulin (the northernmost part of Shaanxi), and stationed in Yushu (in today’s Qinghai Province) to conquer the Yingzhou (in the northwest of Shanxi). Regardless of the opposition of courtiers, Emperor Wuzong personally traveled to the north from Juyong pass, which was thought as a willful move without overall view. However, he did that with his own considerations. Beijing, the capital of the Ming Dynasty was not far from the border. Therefore before left the border, he had certain military arrangements for the capital. He appointed a general to stay in Beijing and command two heavy troops, the “Three Thousand Battalion” and the “Shenji Battalion”. Being the most powerful troops in the Beijing Battalion, the former was the main force of the Beijing cavalry, and the latter was the pioneer  and model of the use of hot weapons in the world. All this above deployment shows Emperor Wuzong’s careful consideration of the defense of the capital.</p>
<p>Emperor Wuzong personally led his troops to fight the Tatar prince in Yingzhou. He arranged not merely the deployment before the war but the deployment of troops during the battle. He was a person with both certain military talents and determination and courage to charge into battle. At that time, Emperor Wuzong ordered the army to attack the Tatar cavalry, but the joining force was blocked for a while which push the situation into extreme urgency. Fortunately, Emperor Wuzong led his troops to the battlefield in time, beheading the first rank, brave and fearless, and turned the tide. Finally they expelled the Mongolian army.</p>
<p>Since the Tumu crisis, the huge losses of the Ming troop defeated by Mongolia, the military strength of the Ming Dynasty has declined. Mongolia’s annual southward intrusion has repeatedly deteriorated the conditions of the northern border. Emperor Wuzong’s visit to the north was the first and last case that emperor of the Ming Dynasty came to the frontline to resist the Mongolian army after the Tumu crisis. In the “Cambridge History of the Ming Dynasty in China”, it is believed that this battle “was actually the only battle in the 16th century where the Ming army drove off the Mongolian assault troops. The emperor’s presence on the battlefield undoubtedly affected the ending.</p>
