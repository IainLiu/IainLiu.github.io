        <p>Under the broad name of the Silk Road, besides the land Silk Road, there are also the maritime Silk Road. The land Silk Road reached its peak in the Sui and Tang Dynasties and then declined due to continuous wars. During this period, the maritime Silk Road entered a period of rapid development. In the early stage, the bulk commodity transported by sea was silk, so it earned its name of the “maritime Silk Road”. During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the bulk commodities it transported turned to porcelain and spices, but the name of the “maritime Silk Road” was preserved. </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p><strong>The ups and downs of the land Silk Road</strong></p>
<p>After the establishment of the land Silk Road in the Western Han Dynasty, its rises and falls in the following two thousand years showed an alternate trend.</p>
<p>The land Silk Road first start to thrive since 119 BC, when Zhang Qian, on his second mission to the Western Regions, established the land Silk Road. Over the next hundred years, the Western Han dynasty was prosperous and strong in power, which bring the prosperity to the land Silk Road. In 9 AD, this ascending period was ended: at the end of the Western Han Dynasty, Wang Mang usurped the throne, followed by continuous wars, and the central plains dynasty lost control of the Western regions.</p>
<p>In 73 AD, 48 years after the founding of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ban Chao went on a diplomatic mission to the Western Regions and put it under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Han Dynasty. More than 140 years later, at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Huang Jin uprising bring chaos to the whole empire, and the land Silk Road fell into decline again, until the Wei, one of the Three Kingdoms, ended its decline by reestablishing the contacts with the Western Regions in 221 BC.</p>
<p>In 221 AD, the strongest of The Three Kingdoms, the Wei, reestablished the contacts with the Western regions, and the land Silk Road began to flourish again. Sixty years later, the Western Jin unified the whole country, making the land Silk Road more prosperous; However, twenty years later, the “Eight Dukes’ Rebellion” took place in the Western Jin Dynasty, and followed by the “Huns invading central plain”. Since then, the central plain has been plunged into a state of separatist wars for nearly two hundred years. During this period, the Northern Wei(a new one established by the Xianbei people) in the Northern Dynasty revived the Silk Road twice, but generally speaking, the land Silk Road was in persistent weakness.</p>
<p>In 624 AD, the Tang Dynasty unified the whole country again. At the same time, the Tang Dynasty defeated the Turks and restored the connection with the Western regions. In 755, after the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang Dynasty was gradually divided into serval vassal states and lost its control over most of the western regions. The land Silk Road fall into declining again.</p>
<p>In 979 AD, the Northern Song Dynasty unified the central plain and began to restore the connection with the Western regions. As a result, the Silk Road was revived. However, due to the Northern Song Dynasty’s failure to control the western regions completely, and the economic center gradually move to the south, the land Silk Road trade condition wasn’t able to revive to its peak. In 1125, the Jin dynasty destroyed the Northern Song Dynasty and the Silk Road entered the declining period again.</p>
<p>From the history records, we can see that the rises and falls of the land Silk Road showed periodic changes, and the prosperity period was accompanied by a unified dynasty or the strong force existed in the north. The reason is that both the unified dynasty and the powerful forces could control the Western regions effectively or resume the communication with the western regions. And its decline period took place when the central plains was at war, and lost control of the Western regions. Thus it can be seen that the rises and falls of the land Silk Road is affected by the political situation of the central Plains easily: the land Silk Road prospers when the central Plains regime was stable, while it declines when the central Plains regime was in chaotic.</p>
<p><strong>The development of the Maritime Silk Road</strong></p>
<p>The maritime Silk Road started forming in the Qin and Han Dynasties, gained great development in the Wei and Jin Dynasties, prospered in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, reached its peak in the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and finally declined in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. In the course of its development, we can find that, except for the decline caused by the empire’s strict maritime prohibition policy in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the maritime Silk Road was always rising no matter what the political situation of the Central Plains dynasty was.</p>
<p>Why had the Maritime Silk Road been always rising?</p>
<p>When the Maritime Silk Road was traded, fleets simply moved from port to port, rather than on land. This means that the maritime Silk Road is free of geopolitical influence on land. In the early Northern Song Dynasty, the road to the Western regions was unimpeded when the Song Dynasty and Western Xia went well, and trade between two states were good. In the middle of the Northern Song Dynasty, the relationship between the Song Dynasty and the Western Xia broke down, the road to the western regions was cut off, the trade also shrunk, and more and more people turn to seek trade route  on the sea. In 1023, when the Dashi state sent envoys to pay tribute, the Song Dynasty responded by “Fearing that the envoys might be robbed, the Emperor ordered them to travel by sea.”; In the third year of the reign of Emperor Shengchang, Gao Chang State sent envoys to send tribute. However, the Court responded pessimistically and refused the envoys to enter the capital, because “the Court worried that envoys might report the Song Dynasty’s military intelligence to the Western Xia.” The convenience of sea lanes thus protects them from the threat of geopolitical change.</p>
<p>Though shipment, merchants can carry far more goods a one time: according to statistics, a land trade caravan can carry around 300 kilograms of goods at a time, while a trade fleet can carry around a ton of goods on a single ship by sea. Land transportation is mainly carried out by horses, camels, etc., with limited carrying capacity, small transport volume, high cost, large consumption and long transporting time. Through ships by sea, merchants can carry larger quantity of goods, with low costs, the small losses, and shorter time. </p>
<p>Moreover, since the middle Tang Dynasty, China’s economic center began to shift to the south. At that time, in addition to Hebei and Henan provinces in the north, the areas rich in silk production were mainly in the south, such as Jiangnan, Huainan, Jiannan and Shannan provinces. Moreover, the tea produced in China is spread all over Jiangnan region(regions south of the Yangtze River), and the developed economy of the Jiangnan region has provided a solid financial foundation for the prosperity of the Maritime Silk Road. In addition, since Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty built the Grand Canal, canal that connect the Hebei province and Zhejiang province, China’s water transport is increasingly developed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the southeast region sophisticated in shipbuilding most, and the shipbuilding industry is also very prosperous, which creates favorable conditions for the development of the maritime Silk Road. In addition to the shipbuilding skills, another important technological factor of contribute to the development of the Maritime Silk Road was the invention and implementation of the compass. Virtually, Chinese people have discovered that magnets had pointing function since the Warring States period. During the Northern Song Dynasty, new methods were discovered to enhance the magnetism of magnets. Together with the primary understanding of longitude and latitude, the compass was invented and widely used in navigation.  With more sophisticated devices, it was more easy for people to ship in the sea. Last but not the least, during the Sui and Tang Dynasties, China adopted a series of policies to protect and encourage overseas trade, which also contributed to the prosperity of the Maritime Silk Road. </p>
<p><strong>The effects of the development of the Maritime Silk Road</strong> </p>
<p>During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the Maritime Silk Road, especially the South China Sea Route, flourished as never before. During the Northern Song Dynasty, nautical maps appeared. This map reflects the topography, hydrological elements, positioning conditions and other navigation-related information and explanations of certain areas. During this period, the Maritime Silk Road continued to extend westward and southward, resulting in new contacts between China and African countries. </p>
<p>Although Chinese porcelain had been imported into Africa since the Tang Dynasty, it was not shipped to Africa in large quantities until the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Large quantities of Chinese porcelain were introduced into Africa, which had a great impact on the lives of local people. Today, a surprising amount of ancient Chinese porcelain is found in East Africa. Some people even call East Africa “the repository of Ancient Chinese porcelain”. An Arab historian once said: “The medieval history of East Africa can be said to be written in Chinese porcelain.” In a sense, the Maritime Silk Road is also the “maritime Porcelain Road”. In addition, the Maritime Silk Road also greatly strengthened China’s political, economic and cultural ties with Japan, Korea and other countries in East Asia.</p>
<p>In today’s North Africa, Egypt is the country with the earliest and closest relationship with China. At that time, the two countries sent envoys mutually, exchanged goods and enjoyed reciprocal preferential trade treatment. Many of the large number of Arab businessmen living in China were Egyptians, and they mainly live in southern seaport cities such as Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou and Yangzhou. What’s more, about the the Arab world. In the porcelain discovered in the famous ship wrack, the Nanhai No.1, many of them were decorated with Arabic drawing. This stated that in that time, there was advance mature commercial system between China and the Arab world. Also, this stated that the commercial development in China, since people were acting like what today merchants do—they target the Arab world as their market and produce what they want.
