        <p>“Trade can make everyone better off”, we have long heard about such sentence. But under certain circumstances, trade can also be harmful…..</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>I’ve participated in a history program lead by a professor from University of Chicago. We will spend 8 weeks on Silk Road stuffs. So in the next few weeks I might pose articles related to the Silk Road.</p>
<p>Anyway. Though this week the Professor will talk about the relations between nomadic people and sedentary people. But as for me, I was reading Song History the whole week. For my final research paper, I want to talk about economic-related things. The article followed might be a good idea, but I am not sure. To be more specific, I want to focus on the tributary trade on the Silk Road.</p>
<p>Tributary trade, as its name implies, was a form of trade by which the central plain Dynasties regards the products of ethnic minorities or other dynasties’ as “Tribute” and the goods they gave back as “Grant”. Its earliest prototype is the Western Zhou dynasty “Wufu” system: This system was a tributary system prescribed by the Zhou Dynasty to the domestic vassals and the border states, and the regulate the quantity of tribute and other matters according to the distance between each region and the capital city. It can be seen from here that since the Zhou Dynasty, the central China civilization has had the concept of “tribute ”. Tributary trade, as a special form of trade with a long history, has existed since the Silk Road was established and experienced many vicissitudes. </p>
<p>The attitude the Song Dynasty held towards tributary trade can be characterized as “The barbarians came to submit, to offer his specialties, to show his status as a minister. The son of heaven accepted his tribute to show his supremacy.”, and the Emperor should “Let them understand the light value of money and the importance of etiquette, so as to understand the noble position of China.” Under this doctrine, the Northern Song Dynasty should always grant tributary states more, while offering envoys favorable treatments.</p>
<p>I can give you serval examples here.</p>
<p>In 1086, Aligu (Now the Tibet) came to pay tributes, then offered “a suit of clothes, 7.5 kilograms of silver, two hundred pieces of clothing, and two hundred jin of tea”and “29,540 guan qian of money”, which amounted to about forty thousand guan qian of money. During the reign of Emperor Zhesong, the seventh Emperor of the Song Dynasty, the Emperor issued the imperial edict indicating that “Adding twenty percent of the value before grant back” for all tributes made by Tubo. In 1674, Dashi paid frankincense as tributes. In addition to the standard grant of 2900 guan qian, Song Dynasty offered another 7.5 kilograms of silver. In 1085, the Yutian state tribute for military horses, and received more than two hundred million guan qian of money as grant, which equals to nearly 4% of the Northern Song Dynasty’s annual fiscal revenue. Most of the tributes were luxuries and jades. Those things seems fancy, but they are useless: these luxuries can neither enter the market to circulate nor give the officials as salaries, but only can be granted to officials as the Emperor’s praise.</p>
<p>Quiet crazy, right?</p>
<p>From my perspective, unlike other trade forms that would make both sides better off, the tributary would definitely harm the Northern Song Dynasty for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Due to the doctrine of “The grants must exceeds the tributes,” it is impossible for the Song Dynasty to make profits through the tributary trade. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The entire Northern Song Dynasty was in fiscal crisis, </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it is always said that the Song Dynast had the most advanced commercial activities in ancient China times, the fact is that the Song Dynasty was always in fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>Overstaffed government officials and soldiers and the followed unnecessarily high expenses mainly contributed to the Song Dynasty’s financial crisis. The annual fiscal revenue of the Song Dynasty was high compared with other dynasties, but its fiscal expenditure was also far higher than other dynasties. </p>
<p>Overstaffed soldiers occupied the largest fiscal expenditure. The Northern Song Dynasty recruited the unemployed into the army to maintain social stability. This method succeeded in maintaining social stability—there were no civil uprisings during the northern Song Dynasty. But this method lead to inflation in army’s population. At the beginning of the northern Song Dynasty, there were 220000 people in the army; but 40 years later, there were 1250000 people in the army—a crazy number, right? This number exceeds all the dynasties in ancient China times. Huge army population led to high military expenditure—the military expenditure occupied almost half of the empire’s annual fiscal revenue. The population of the troop increased four times over that of the beginning of the Song Dynasty, but the nation’s population merely increased two times over that of the beginning of the Song Dynasty. The annual fiscal revenue increased 100% over that of the before, but the military expenditure increased two times over that of the before. This means that the military spending was expanding faster than the economy growth. Military expenditure put heavy pressure on national finance.</p>
<p>Overstaffed government officials was the second largest contributor of the fiscal crisis. The Emperor Taizu got his throne through mutiny, so his naturally distrust military officers, and sent many civil officials to the army to check the military officers. Meanwhile, in order to prevent the partisan wrangle, he set additional government posts to reach the check and balance between government officials. At the beginning of the northern Song Dynasty, there were 2200 officials in total; around 50 years later, that number inflated to 17300. Statistics told us that during the middle period of the northern Song Dynasty, the expenditure on officials’ salaries was 5 million min qian, about 8% of the annual revenue. Plus other expenditures on government operations, the total expenditure on government officials could reach 10 million min qian, about one sixth of the annual fiscal revenue.</p>
<p>Though the northern Song Dynasty had a high fiscal revenue, about 60 million min qian, based on analysis before, we can learn that its expenditure was also high, and the inevitable royal family’s expenditure and ritual expenditure were not included.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned before, those tributes can neither enter the market to circulate nor give the officials as salaries, but only can be granted to officials as the Emperor’s praise, which were useless in alleviating the empire’s fiscal revenue. So under such facts, I think the tributary trade was harming the northern Song Dynasty.  </p>
